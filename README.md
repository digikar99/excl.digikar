An alpha-quality Common Lisp extension that includes:

- [polymorphic-functions](https://github.com/digikar99/polymorphic-functions/): functions to dispatch on types
- [extensible-compound-types](https://github.com/digikar99/extensible-compound-types/): allows one to define one's own compound types beyond the aliasing provided by cl:deftype
- [dense-arrays](https://github.com/digikar99/dense-arrays/): a cleaner array with greater functionality

In addition, this also provides:

- [trivial-coerce](https://github.com/digikar99/trivial-coerce) to provide a unified interface for type conversion
- [osicat](https://github.com/osicat/osicat)
- [py4cl2](https://github.com/digikar99/py4cl2)
- [lisp-polymorph](https://github.com/lisp-polymorph) - a polymorphic-functions based non/shadowing systems for a more unified interface
